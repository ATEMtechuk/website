          We plan to use AI extensively to support automated features of the device, such as event suggestions and image scanning, but the implementation strategy remains to be defined

        <p class="AIpoweredText3">
          Since AI tools can be costly, we will initiate the process once project funding is secured. We will start with a <strong>minimum viable product</strong> (MVP) and then gradually add more features as we receive feedback from our users​.
        </p>
        <p class="AIpoweredText4">
          We plan to use Microsoft Azure for our infrastructure and leverage machine learning libraries such as PyTorch Lightning, Tesseract OCR, and spaCy for model development and natural language processing​.

          Multiple YouTube video showcasing DIY versions of our product have garnered millions of impressions, all positive and supportive of a commercially available version, with whole communities on Reddit trading advice on how to DIY a digital dashboard/calendar.​

          <em><u>Our Story</u></em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are, Zane Bedeau (21) and Daniel Zacharias (22), the founders of Strida. Our journey into the world of productivity began as we sought ways to organize our lives, set goals, and build lasting habits. Like many, we were drawn to productivity apps—habit trackers, to-do lists, time-blocking calendars—and tried everything we could to stay on top of our commitments. But no matter how many apps we used, something was missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem wasn’t a lack of information or tools; it was the way those tools were scattered across our phones and devices. Productivity apps lived on our phones, the same place filled with endless distractions. We were also constantly switching between different apps for tasks, habits, and calendars, making it hard to see the bigger picture of our goals and how they were connected. Most importantly, the moment we closed an app, the focus faded. Out of sight, out of mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s when we had an idea: What if there was a device that could combine all of these productivity tools in one simple, visual, distraction-free display? A device that would be a constant reminder of our goals, tailored to our individual needs, and designed to help us achieve those goals without the distraction of our phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is how Strida was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strida is a smart, AI-powered productivity display that integrates your goals, habits, and calendar into one seamless system. With Strida, you can clearly see and track your progress every day, without the temptation of digital distractions. The AI works behind the scenes to optimize your schedule and habits, making sure that everything aligns with your long-term objectives. Whether it’s nudging you to stay on track when you fall behind or adjusting your habits based on progress, Strida works with you to ensure your goals are within reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe productivity should be about more than just planning; it should be about taking action and building the habits that move you forward. Strida makes that possible by bringing all your productivity tools into one place and actively helping you stay focused, organized, and motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          After months of development, we’re ready to bring Strida to life, and we need your support to manufacture our first batch and bring this vision to the world. With Strida, we can create a smarter, more intentional way to achieve our goals, and we’d love for you to be a part of that journey.
